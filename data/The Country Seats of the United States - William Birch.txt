AMERICAN SEATS.


The Fine Arts are, as to the American Nation at large, in their
infancy; to promote them in propagating Taste with the habit of rural
retirement, supported by the growing wealth of the Nation, will be to
form the National character favourable to the civilization of this
young country, and establish that respectability which will add to its
strength.

The comforts and advantages of a Country Residence, after Domestic
accommodations are consulted, consist more in the beauty of the
situation, than in the massy magnitude of the edifice: the choice
ornaments of Architecture are by no means intended to be disparaged,
they are on the contrary, not simply desirable, but requisite. The
man of taste will select his situation with skill, and add elegance
and animation to the best choice. In the United States the face of
nature is so variegated. Nature has been so sportive, and the means so
easy of acquiring positions fit to gratify the most refined and rural
enjoyment, that labour and expenditure of Art is not so great as in
Countries less favoured.

It would be impossible to do justice in a work, such as this is
intended to be, without appropriating some plates to the sports of wild
unregulated nature: the Woods, Lawns, broken Precipices and Crags: the
curious and sublime of the Forest Trees: the Cataracts and Rivers: the
blue Capt Mountains, and the deep, retired, and darksome Vallies.

Such scenes which decorate the grounds, and form the choicest Pictures
of themselves, and which cannot be brought into the same Plate with the
Villa, will be given separately, as highly necessary to form a full and
correct idea of the American Country Residence.

HOBOKEN,

Is seated upon a prominent rock on the North River; and commands
an extensive view, embracing New-York, Long Island, Staten Island,
Governor’s Island, and the Bay to the Narrows, and, on the other hand,
a perspective of North River.


HAMPTON,

Stands on a spherical rise of ground, from whose valley emerges a wide
amphitheatre of elegant inland country.


LANDSDOWN,

Lies upon the bank of the Pastoral Schuylkill, a stream of peculiar
beauty, deservedly the delight and boast of the shores it fertilizes.
The house was built upon a handsome and correct plan by the former
governor Penn.


ECHO,

An elegant situation on the bank of Schuylkill, near the suburbs of
the city: rich in every wild luxury which nature can afford to the
plastic hand of art. The house is of no note, and its scite not well
chosen. It derives its name from the reverberations given from the
opposite shore--particularly by a rock memorable for having been in
the revolution the place of encampment for the British, while Gen.
Washington and his army were on this spot.


MOUNT VERNON,

This hallowed mansion is founded upon a rocky eminence, a dignified
height on the Potomac. During the French war, Admiral Vernon, who
commanded the British fleet on this station, frequently made visits
to his friend the father of Gen. W. and thence is derived its name.
The additions of a piazza to the water front, and of a drawing room,
are proofs of the legitimacy of the General’s taste. It is now the
residence of Judge Washington.


FOUNTAIN GREEN,

On the Schuylkill, highly favored by nature, and capable of vast
improvement. Upon the half ascent of the bank from the river, the new
canal will pass the house and if ever finished, will become a great
ornament to the place.


SOLITUDE.

Here a pleasing solitude at once speaks the propriety of its title.
Upon further research the solitary rocks, and the waters of Schuylkill
add sublimity to quietness. The house is built with great taste for a
bachelor, by the former Governor John Penn, since the revolution.


DEVON,

An airy and pleasant situation on the Pennsylvania shore of the
Delaware, fourteen miles from Philadelphia. The house was built by Mr.
Jos. Anthony.


MOUNT SIDNEY,

Derives its honorable name from the patriot Algernon, who died in the
reign of Charles II. a martyr to liberty. Its sylvan scene mingle with
the romantic wilds of Sedgely.


THE SEAT OF MR. DUPLANTIER,

Exhibits a style of building familiar to the West Indies, and well
adapted to the warm climate of our newly acquired territory. The
situation is verdant, and throughout the year, the air is fragrant with
the perfume of orange groves. In the distance is descried the port and
shipping of New Orleans.


MONTIBELLO,

Handsomely seated amid the woods, a few miles from Baltimore, and
commanding a prospect of the Chesapeake and Baltimore Bays. The house
was built by Gen. S. Smith, from a plan and elevation designed by Mr.
W. Birch, the proprietor of this work, and is generally approved.


WOODLANDS.

This noble demesne has long been the pride of Pennsylvania. The
beauties of nature and the rarities of art, not more than the
hospitality of the owner, attract to it many visitors. It is charmingly
situated on the winding Schuylkill, and commands one of the most
superb water scenes that can be imagined. The ground is laid out in
good taste. There are here a hot house and green house containing a
collection in the horticultural department, unequalled perhaps in the
United States. Paintings &c. of the first master embellish the interior
of the house, and do credit to Mr. Wm. Hamilton, as a man of refined
taste.... It is about a mile from the city of Philadelphia.


SEDGELY.

This beautiful gothic structure, which so happily graces the luxuriant
banks of Schuylkill, is in the neighbourhood of Landsdown, which
is seen in the distance on the opposite side of the river, whose
gentle stream courses lowly and humble, amidst romantic woods, gently
descending lawns and caverned rocks. The house was erected by Mr.
Crammond, from a design by that able architect, Mr. J. H. Latrobe.


BELMONT.

It is impossible for the artist, who has fixed his attention upon the
various beauties of Schuylkill, to leave the study of its charms. Here
you pass from the wild romantic scene; the rugged stone with wood and
water bound to expand the sight from this high lifted lawn, to view
in open space the world below, the riches of the richest state; the
big metropolis in the woods, the chequered country with her merchants’
seats; the bustle of agriculture, and the verdant banks of the fluid
mirror that reflects the sky; and further on to view Mount Holly
mingled with the air in Jersey. The whole a soft and visionary scene.


YORK ISLAND.

This view is taken from the piazza of the seat of General Stevens on
Long Island, near that extraordinary channel called Hell-gate, on the
East river, or sound. The view was taken in the morning at the rising
of the sun, when a glow of light from the arch of Heaven, exhibited to
the view almost innumerable seats, spread over an extensive country
which glittered as the sun arose, like so many stars in the firmament,
upon the face of this beautifully variegated Island. The scene
extending across the North river to the Jersey shore.


MENDENHALL FERRY.

This beautiful spot close upon the falls of Schuylkill, and central to
the neighbouring seats of Philadelphia, is one of nature’s choicest
retreats. Mr. Mendenhall, to accommodate the citizens, has opened his
house for public entertainment. The two seats on the bank, are those of
Mr. Joseph Sims, and the justly celebrated Dr. Physick, the latter is
called very appropriately Fairy Hill.


CHINA RETREAT.

An airy and pleasant situation on the Delaware, 17 miles from
Philadelphia. The house was built by Mr. Van Braam, late ambassador
from Holland to China. It was here he prepared for the press his
account of that embassy together with the manners and characters of the
Chinese, and which was published at a great expense in London. Now the
summer residence of the family of Mr. Manigaull, of S. Carolina.


SPRINGLAND.

This spot chosen by the artist for the exercise of his taste in
retirement has peculiar beauties from nature. Art has added much to it,
and the cottage is embellished with a small, but very fine collection
of paintings by some of the first masters. This volume with his other
works may be had at this place.
